# Predicting House Prices with Python

Predicting House Prices is a classic machine learning project that falls under the domain of regression. In this project, the goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a house based on various features or attributes of that house. Let's dive into the project in more detail:

**Project Overview: Predicting House Prices**

**Problem Statement:**

- Objective: To predict the selling price of a house.
- Type: Regression problem.
- Dataset: Historical data containing information about houses and their corresponding selling prices.

This project is a great way to learn about data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques commonly used in machine learning and data science. Additionally, it has practical applications in the real estate industry and can be a valuable tool for making informed decisions about property investments.
